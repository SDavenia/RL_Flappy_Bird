# Reinforcement_Learning
Project for the UniTS reinforcement learning course AA 2022-23.

# Flappy Bird solver
The idea is teach an agent how to play the flappy bird game using the text gym environment which can be found at: https://gitlab-research.centralesupelec.fr/stergios.christodoulidis/text-flappy-bird-gym/-/tree/master.

The agent will have no knowledge of the environment but perfect observability of the states. As such it is phrased as a model-free reinforcement learning problem. 

Standard RL techniques for policy control will be attempted and compared:
- Q-Learning
- SARSA
- (?) Expected SARSA
- (?) MC control
